> [!NOTE]
> Here is a list of completed Labs.

> ### Completed Labs in SQL injection:
> - SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data (Apprentice)
> - SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass (Apprentice)
> - SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft (Practitioner)
> - SQL injection attack, listing the database on non-Oracle databases (Practitioner)
> - SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query (Practitioner)
> - SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text (Practitioner)
> - SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables (Practitioner)
> - SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column (Practitioner)
> - Blind SQL injection with conditional responses (Practitioner)

> ### Completed Labs in Cross-site scripting:
>  - Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded (Apprentice)
>  - Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded (Apprentice)

> ### Completed Labs in Authentication:
>  - Username enumeration via different responses (Apprentice)
>  - 2FA simple bypass (Apprentice)
>  - Password reset broken logic (Apprentice)

> ### Completed Labs in Access control vulnerabilities:
>  - Unprotected admin functionality (Apprentice)
>  - Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL (Apprentice)
>  - User role controlled by request parameter (Apprentice)

> [!NOTE]
> Now let's take a look at what was the Pros and Cons while using Portsvigger with Burp Suite Community Edition.

> ### Pros in Portswigger Labs:
>  - I enjoyed to do the tasks and accomplish them. This gives great practical experience on the subjects.
>  - The tasks are very clear, and also the instructions are crystal clear. This makes learning a lot faster and efficient.

> ### Cons in Portswigger Labs:
> - The attacking part of some of the Labs is extremely slow with the Burp Suite Community Edition, and I lack the knowledge to do a script with python for example to do these attacks instead.
